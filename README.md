# Larryc
Larryc is an asynchronous dictionary-search engine that runs in your terminal with a pleasing UI. It is depending on the [dictionary api](https://dictionaryapi.dev/). And, the UI is written using the [Rich framework](https://github.com/Textualize/rich).

## Motivation
First of all, nobody these days carries dictionaries. Second of all, not everyone likes to use the browser for everything. Especially me. I feel like small things like this should be done in the terminal, which is fast and straight to point. Larryc is **maybe** going to solve the *dictionary* crysis. That's what I'm calling it. 

## Installation & Usage
- Cross-platform (Python must be installed):
```bash
# Install the package (pip required).
pip install larryc

# Basic command-line usage.
python -m larryc archeology # You can use any word in place of archeology here.
```
